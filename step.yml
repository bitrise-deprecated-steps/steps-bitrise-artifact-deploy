        Specify the directory or file path which will be deployed.
        If the specified path is a directory then every file
        in the directory will be deployed - but only the
        files in the specified directory, sub-directories
        won't be uploaded. For uploading the directory's content
        recursively you should use the *Compress* option
        which will compress the whole directory, with
        every sub-directory included.

        If you specify a file path then only the specified
        file will be deployed.
